# DesertOasis

Desert Oasis is a web app that aims to connect New Yorkers living in food deserts to farmer's markets accepting EBT benefits. The app also features a budget management tool to help users set and abide by cash and SNAP budgets.

Once users login to their personal dashboard with their username and password, they can:
* View their current SNAP and cash budgets, or create new ones
* See a map with nearby farmers markets

### Desert Oasis is built on a number of great tools and open source projects, including:
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) -- An open source library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) -- A Node.js framework designed for building web applications and APIs
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) -- An environment for easily building fast and scalable network applications in JavaScript
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) -- A powerful API that allows developers to enhance location experiences for their users

Desert Oasis requires Node and a global installation of Webpack to run.
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm install -g webpack
```

To run the web app:

Clone this repository, then:
